# ðŸ”¥ Clean Spotify Player
![](./demo/whatsgood.png)

A simple app that displays pleasing visuals for your currently playing music on Spotify.
## Try it!
App is available here: [https://clean-spotify.club](https://clean-spotify.club).

## What's new?
Apart from being rewritten from scrach with different tech stack, the player has a new display mode inspired by the one recently introduced by the official Spotify desktop app. Also I changed hosting method of the project, so that there are no 10s cold starts of the backend (I even threw out fancy loader because there's no need for it anymore ðŸ˜…). 

## Tech stack
- NextJS
- Typescript
- Xstate for state management (my first time using it)
- useSWR for data fetching
- styled-components, styled-system and atomic-layout for the layout
- node-vibrant for sampling color palettes
